Docsy and DocsyCannon are open source projects and love getting patches and contributions to make them even better. We do not want to divide contributors attention away from the main Docsy theme so most changes to the theme are best directed there, and DocsyCannon will endeavour to keep up to date with the main Docsy theme. However, if you have any changes that are specific to DocsyCannon rather than Docsy, we would welcome your contributions.​
